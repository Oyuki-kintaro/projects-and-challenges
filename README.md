# python-practice

The following python3 programs are based off codecademy challenges

## TicTacToe.py

Play a game of tictactoe with another person or against the computer. This program only demonstrate the base fundamental logic of python (string, lists, dictionaries, etc..)

Currently the program is basic. There is no notification of who the winner is. The game will continue until all spots are filled even if someone has already won, and the computer plays random values instead of playing a value that will help it win or prevent the player from winning.
